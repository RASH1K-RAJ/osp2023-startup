1. Remember to Check Valgrind on the files you made
2. Remember to Check on the server
3. Ask do we have to make sure that the command line arguments we get are the correct format?
4.Remember to create deconstructors for the classes.
5. So if no of threads given is 25 does that mean 25 reader and 25 writer.

6.Suppose the queue ends and the file isn't empty then do you use conditional
variable out there to wait till the file is empty and the queue is full.
